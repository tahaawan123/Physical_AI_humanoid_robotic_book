# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Textbook

Welcome to the *Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics* textbook — a practical, project-driven course designed to teach you how to design, simulate, and control humanoid robots using modern AI techniques.

This textbook covers:
- ROS 2 (Robotic Nervous System)
- Simulation with Gazebo & Unity (Digital Twins)
- NVIDIA Isaac Sim & Isaac ROS
- Vision-Language-Action (VLA) systems
- Hardware & Edge AI (Jetson kits, RealSense)
- Humanoid design, kinematics, locomotion, manipulation
- Hands-on projects and a capstone: Autonomous Humanoid

Use the sidebar to navigate modules. Each module includes theory, conceptual diagrams, design patterns, and non-executable procedural steps for labs and demonstrations.
