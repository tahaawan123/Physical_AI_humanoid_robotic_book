# Module 2: Simulation & Digital Twins

Simulation is the bridge between design and reality. In this module you'll:
- Set up Gazebo and create SDF/URDF-based robots conceptually.
- Use Unity for high-fidelity rendering and interactive HRI testing.
- Simulate sensors: cameras, LiDAR, IMU, contact sensors.
- Plan datasets for synthetic data generation to train perception models.

## Learning Activities (static)
- Design a simulated environment checklist (lighting, textures, physics parameters).
- Create a dataset plan: object types, poses, lighting variations, annotation schema.
- Define sim-to-real transfer steps: domain randomization list, system ID parameters to record.
