# Action & Control

Action systems convert planned tasks into actuator commands.

Topics (non-code):
- Motion planning frameworks and their tradeoffs.
- Inverse kinematics conceptual walkthrough.
- RL vs model-based control: when to use each.

## Safety Layer (text)
- Define runtime checks: collision, joint limits, torque thresholds.
- Human override and safe-stop patterns.
