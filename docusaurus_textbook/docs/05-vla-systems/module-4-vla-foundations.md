# Module 4: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) Systems - Foundations

## Bridging Perception, Cognition, and Embodiment

VLA systems enable robots to perceive, understand, and act. This module focuses on architecture, model choices and deployment patterns — presented as design patterns and non-executable examples.

---

## Learning Outcomes (static)

After this module, students will be able to:
- Describe VLA system components and their interfaces.
- Create a multimodal pipeline diagram that shows how sensors → perception → LLM planner → action generator interact.
- List evaluation metrics for perception and actionable tasks.
- Discuss ethical and safety considerations in multimodal robotics.

## Design Patterns & Diagrams

Include conceptual diagrams for:
- Multimodal fusion (vision + language features → planner)
- Closed-loop perception-planning-action cycles
- Safety monitors and human override channels
