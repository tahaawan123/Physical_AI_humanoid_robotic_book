# Language in VLA

Language topics (conceptual):
- Command parsing strategies and intent-slot frameworks.
- Role of LLMs as planners vs. rule-based planners.
- Strategies for confirmation, ambiguity resolution, and safety checks.

## Practical Design Notes
- Decide whether LLM runs locally (small models) or remotely (cloud).
- Define fallbacks and human-in-the-loop policies for critical commands.
