# Module 6: Humanoid Design

## Topics Covered
- URDF/Xacro design patterns (modularity, reusability).
- Kinematics overview: forward/inverse, joint chains and task spaces.
- Dynamics and stability: ZMP, CoM, gait generation concepts.
- Hands & manipulation: grasp taxonomy, compliance, sensor integration.

## Lab & Deliverables (static)
- Provide a design checklist for a humanoid limb (links to references in Appendix).
- Produce a gait analysis plan describing step timing, foot placement, and stability margins.
