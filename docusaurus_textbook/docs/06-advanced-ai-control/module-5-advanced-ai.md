# Module 5: Advanced AI & Control

Topics (textual):
- Reinforcement learning concepts and pipelines for robots.
- Domain randomization checklist and parameter lists for sim-to-real.
- Hierarchical control: high-level planners, mid-level skills, low-level controllers.
- Subagent and skill design patterns: interfaces, capabilities, and testing strategies.

## Project ideas (static)
- Write a design doc for a hierarchical manager that takes LLM plans and dispatches skills.
- Create an evaluation plan for sim-to-real transfer focusing on robustness metrics.
