--- id: 0005 title: Generate Textbook Project Tasks stage: tasks date: 2025-11-28 surface: agent model: claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929 feature: textbook-project-structure branch: master user: karakurom traders command: /sp.tasks Generate atomic tasks from specs/textbook/spec.md and specs/textbook/plan.md for the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics textbook project. Key Guidelines: - Break into 4 phases: - Phase 1: Project Setup (3-4 tasks, 45-60 min): Docusaurus init, folder structure, basic config for GitHub Pages. - Phase 2: Content Creation (6-8 tasks, 90-120 min): Research/write 10+ chapters across 4 modules (ROS 2, Gazebo/Unity, NVIDIA Isaac, VLA); include code snippets, diagrams per module. - Phase 3: RAG & Bonuses Integration (4-6 tasks, 60-90 min): Build/embed RAG chatbot (FastAPI/Neon/Qdrant); add bonuses (Claude Subagents for reusables, Better-Auth signup/quiz, personalization/Urdu buttons per chapter). - Phase 4: Testing & Deploy (2-3 tasks, 30-45 min): Validate (90% RAG accuracy on 20 queries), accessibility check, deploy to GitHub Pages. - Each task: 15-30 min, one testable acceptance criterion, clear dependencies (e.g., chapters after setup), verifiable output (e.g., file created/updated), traceable to spec (e.g., "10+ chapters" → "Write Module 1 Ch1"). - Place checkpoints at end of each phase: Human review output vs. criteria, approve/commit before next. - Incorporate ADRs (e.g., Qdrant for RAG) into criteria; bonuses optional but sequenced (e.g., auth before personalization). - Timeline: Total 4-6 weeks; dependencies logical (e.g., research concurrent with writing where possible). - Ensure free tiers, simulation focus, MIT license.

The tasks are organized into four phases: Project Setup, Content Creation, RAG & Bonuses Integration, and Testing & Deploy, with clear dependencies and acceptance criteria. ## Outcome - ✅ Impact: Task list generated. - 🧪 Tests: N/A - 📁 Files: specs/1-textbook-project-structure/tasks.md created. - 🔁 Next prompts: Proceed to implementation using the generated tasks. - 🧠 Reflection: Task list generated successfully, adhering to all specified guidelines for phases, task granularity, and content. Script execution for PHR failed, requiring agent-native creation. ## Evaluation notes (flywheel) - Failure modes observed: `create-phr.sh` script not found. - Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): N/A - Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A - Next experiment (smallest change to try): Ensure `create-phr.sh` script is available or improve agent-native PHR creation.
