--- id: 0002 title: Create Textbook Project Structure and Spec stage: spec date: 2025-11-28 surface: agent model: claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929 feature: textbook-project-structure branch: master user: karakurom traders command: /sp.specify Create the complete empty folder and file structure for the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics textbook project. Do NOT write any chapter content yet — only create all the required files and folders with proper names and paths. Use the standard Docusaurus + Spec-Kit Plus structure that works perfectly with GitHub Pages deployment. Requirements: - Root folder name: physical-ai-humanoid-robotics-textbook - Use Docusaurus v3 structure - Include all necessary config files for immediate GitHub Pages deploy - Add separate folders for specs, chapters, assets, RAG backend - Add placeholder files for bonus features (auth, personalization, Urdu translation) - Add .gitignore, README.md, and deployment workflow Create every single file and folder (even if empty) in one go using your file creation capability. After creating the structure, show me the full tree so I can verify before we start filling content. labels: ["spec", "structure"] links: spec: specs/1-textbook-project-structure/spec.md ticket: null adr: null pr: null files: - physical-ai-humanoid-robotics-textbook/.github/workflows/deploy.yml - physical-ai-humanoid-robotics-textbook/.gitignore - physical-ai-humanoid-robotics-textbook/README.md - physical-ai-humanoid-robotics-textbook/docusaurus.config.js - physical-ai-humanoid-robotics-textbook/src/pages/index.js - physical-ai-humanoid-robotics-textbook/src/pages/_bonus_auth.js - physical-ai-humanoid-robotics-textbook/src/pages/_bonus_personalization.js - physical-ai-humanoid-robotics-textbook/src/pages/_bonus_urdu.js - physical-ai-humanoid-robotics-textbook/src/css/custom.css - physical-ai-humanoid-robotics-textbook/docs/chapters/chapter1.md - physical-ai-humanoid-robotics-textbook/docs/chapters/chapter2.md - physical-ai-humanoid-robotics-textbook/specs/1-textbook-project-structure/spec.md - physical-ai-humanoid-robotics-textbook/RAG-backend/README.md - physical-ai-humanoid-robotics-textbook/package.json - physical-ai-humanoid-robotics-textbook/babel.config.js - physical-ai-humanoid-robotics-textbook/postcss.config.js - physical-ai-humanoid-robotics-textbook/sidebars.js - physical-ai-humanoid-robotics-textbook/specs/1-textbook-project-structure/checklists/requirements.md tests: null --- ## Prompt Create the complete empty folder and file structure for the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics textbook project. Do NOT write any chapter content yet — only create all the required files and folders with proper names and paths.

After creating the structure, show me the full tree so I can verify before we start filling content. ## Response snapshot The folder and file structure for the "Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics" textbook project has been created successfully, and the feature specification (spec.md) has been generated and validated. All checklist items passed. ## Outcome - ✅ Impact: Project structure and spec created. - 🧪 Tests: Spec validated against checklist (all pass). - 📁 Files: New project structure and spec file created. - 🔁 Next prompts: Proceed to planning or content creation. - 🧠 Reflection: Manual file/folder creation and PHR generation were necessary due to script execution failure. ## Evaluation notes (flywheel) - Failure modes observed: `create-new-feature.ps1` and `create-phr.sh` scripts not found (likely due to missing PowerShell environment). - Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): N/A - Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A - Next experiment (smallest change to try): Address script execution environment or enhance agent-native file system operations.
