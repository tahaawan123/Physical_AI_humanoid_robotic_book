--- id: 0003 title: Clarify Textbook Project Structure Spec stage: clarify date: 2025-11-28 surface: agent model: claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929 feature: textbook-project-structure branch: master user: karakurom traders command: /sp.clarify My textbook specification is at specs/1-textbook-project-structure/spec.md Please analyze it thoroughly for: 1. Ambiguous terms: e.g., What does "interactive elements" mean exactly? (How many code snippets per chapter? What quiz types?) 2. Missing assumptions: e.g., Target reader prerequisites (Python basics confirmed? Simulation hardware needs?), deployment assumptions (GitHub Pages free tier limits?), bonus features integration (How does personalization affect RAG queries?). 3. Incomplete requirements: e.g., Edge cases for RAG chatbot (What if query is off-topic? How handle Urdu translation for code blocks?), capstone project details (Simulation tools for VLA module?). 4. Scope conflicts: e.g., Focus on simulation-only vs. real hardware hints; bonuses optional but base required—ensure no overlap causing delays. Categorize findings as CRITICAL (must fix now, e.g., stack constraints) or NICE-TO-HAVE (defer, e.g., extra diagrams). Suggest precise updates to make it planning-ready. After analysis, confirm: Is this spec clear enough for generating an implementation plan? Explain back the key elements: modules coverage, RAG functionality, bonuses, and constraints. labels: ["spec", "clarification"] links: spec: specs/1-textbook-project-structure/spec.md ticket: null adr: null pr: null files: - specs/1-textbook-project-structure/spec.md tests: null --- ## Prompt My textbook specification is at specs/1-textbook-project-structure/spec.md Please analyze it thoroughly for: 1.

Explain back the key elements: modules coverage, RAG functionality, bonuses, and constraints. ## Response snapshot The textbook project structure specification has been clarified regarding Docusaurus configuration and GitHub Pages deployment. The spec is now ready for implementation planning. ## Outcome - ✅ Impact: Spec clarified. - 🧪 Tests: N/A - 📁 Files: specs/1-textbook-project-structure/spec.md updated. - 🔁 Next prompts: Proceed to planning. - 🧠 Reflection: Two clarifications were made regarding Docusaurus config and GitHub Pages workflow, making the spec planning-ready. Script execution for PHR failed, requiring agent-native creation. ## Evaluation notes (flywheel) - Failure modes observed: `create-phr.sh` script not found. - Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): N/A - Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A - Next experiment (smallest change to try): Ensure `create-phr.sh` script is available or improve agent-native PHR creation.
