The constitution should emphasize: 1. *Interdisciplinary Collaboration*: Stress the importance of collaboration across AI, robotics, biomechanics, cognitive science, and ethics. 2. *Ethical AI Development*: Highlight the necessity of ethical standards, human well-being, autonomy, privacy, fairness, bias detection, transparency, and accountability. 3. *Robustness & Safety Engineering*: Emphasize engineering for extreme robustness, reliability, and safety in unpredictable environments, including risk assessment and rigorous testing. 4. *Human-Robot Interaction Design*: Focus on intuitive, natural, and trustworthy human-robot interaction, considering psychological, social, and cultural factors. 5. *Continuous Learning & Adaptation*: Include the principle of systems designed to continuously learn, adapt, and improve through real-world interaction. Also, add sections for "Technical Standards" (leveraging simulation, hardware-software co-design) and "Research & Development Workflow" (iterative, hypothesis-driven, peer review, knowledge transfer). The governance section should reflect these new principles. labels: ["constitution", "update"] links: spec: null ticket: null adr: null pr: null files: - .specify/memory/constitution.md tests: null --- ## Prompt Update the project constitution to reflect the core principles and guidelines for a textbook project on "Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics".

The governance section should reflect these new principles. ## Response snapshot The project constitution has been updated to version 1.1.0, incorporating new principles for Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics. Manual review of `plan-template.md`, `spec-template.md`, `tasks-template.md`, and `commands/*.md` is recommended for consistency. ## Outcome - ✅ Impact: Constitution updated. - 🧪 Tests: N/A - 📁 Files: .specify/memory/constitution.md updated. - 🔁 Next prompts: Review updated templates for consistency. - 🧠 Reflection: Constitution updated to incorporate new principles and sections related to Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics. Templates need manual review for consistency. ## Evaluation notes (flywheel) - Failure modes observed: `create-phr.sh` script not found. - Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): N/A - Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A - Next experiment (smallest change to try): Ensure `create-phr.sh` script is available or improve agent-native PHR creation.
