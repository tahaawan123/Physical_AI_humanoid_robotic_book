--- id: 0004 title: Create Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Textbook Plan stage: plan date: 2025-11-28 surface: agent model: claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929 feature: textbook-project-structure branch: master user: karakurom traders command: /sp.plan Create for the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics textbook project: Architecture sketch: High-level components (Docusaurus site, RAG backend with FastAPI/Neon/Qdrant, auth/personalization layer via Better-Auth, translation module). Section structure: 10+ chapters across 4 modules (ROS 2, Gazebo/Unity, NVIDIA Isaac, VLA); include intro/conclusion; per-chapter buttons for personalization/Urdu. Research approach: Gather resources concurrently (e.g., ROS tutorials while writing Module 1); cite 5+ sources per module. Quality validation: Test RAG accuracy (90%+ on 20 queries), deploy to GitHub Pages, simulate user flows (signup quiz → personalized chapter). Implementation phases: Phase 1: Core book structure; Phase 2: RAG integration; Phase 3: Bonuses (Subagents, Auth, Personalization, Translation); Phase 4: Testing/Deploy. Dependencies: Docusaurus setup before chapters; RAG DB before chatbot embed; Bonuses sequential if time-bound. Decisions needing documentation: List 3-5 key choices with options/tradeoffs, e.g., RAG vector DB (Qdrant vs. in-memory—free tier pros/cons); Research-concurrent vs. upfront (for module examples); Personalization depth (simple tips vs. full rewrite). Technical details: - Follow MIT license, WCAG accessible. - Use free tiers only; simulation focus (no real hardware). - Timeline: 4-6 weeks total.

Output to specs/textbook/plan.md. ## Response snapshot The architectural plan for the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics textbook project has been created and saved to `specs/1-textbook-project-structure/plan.md`. The plan outlines the architecture sketch, section structure, research approach, quality validation, implementation phases, dependencies, and key decisions. ## Outcome - ✅ Impact: Architectural plan created. - 🧪 Tests: N/A - 📁 Files: specs/1-textbook-project-structure/plan.md created. - 🔁 Next prompts: Review the plan for approval and proceed to tasks generation. - 🧠 Reflection: The plan was generated successfully based on user input. Script execution for PHR failed, requiring agent-native creation. ## Evaluation notes (flywheel) - Failure modes observed: `create-phr.sh` script not found. - Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): N/A - Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A - Next experiment (smallest change to try): Ensure `create-phr.sh` script is available or improve agent-native PHR creation.
