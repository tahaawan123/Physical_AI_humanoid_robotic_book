### User Story 1 - Initialize Textbook Project (Priority: P1)

A project maintainer wants to quickly set up the foundational structure for the "Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics" textbook, ensuring it follows Docusaurus v3 standards, includes necessary deployment configurations, and has dedicated areas for content, specifications, assets, and bonus features.

**Why this priority**: This is the foundational step for any further development or content creation for the textbook. Without a proper structure, no other work can proceed efficiently.

**Independent Test**: The project maintainer can verify the presence of all specified folders and placeholder files, ensuring the structure is ready for content population and deployment setup.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1.  **Given** a new project environment, **When** the project structure is initialized, **Then** a `physical-ai-humanoid-robotics-textbook` root directory is created containing the Docusaurus v3 standard files and folders.
2.  **Given** the Docusaurus v3 structure is in place, **When** additional project-specific folders are created, **Then** `specs/`, `docs/chapters/`, `docs/assets/images/`, `docs/assets/files/`, and `RAG-backend/` directories are present.
3.  **Given** the project structure is created, **When** placeholder files for bonus features are added, **Then** `src/pages/_bonus_auth.js`, `src/pages/_bonus_personalization.js`, and `src/pages/_bonus_urdu.js` exist.
4.  **Given** the project structure is created, **When** essential configuration and meta files are added, **Then** `.gitignore`, `README.md`, `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`, `package.json`, `babel.config.js`, `postcss.config.js`, and `sidebars.js` are present.

### Edge Cases

- What happens if the root folder already exists? (Not applicable for this feature, as it assumes a new project setup).
- How does the system handle missing Docusaurus configuration files? (The feature ensures all are created).

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-11-28

- Q: Are there any specific Docusaurus plugins, themes, or custom configurations (e.g., Markdown features, search integration) that should be pre-configured in `docusaurus.config.js` or `package.json` at this initial structure setup stage? (Even if just empty placeholders or minimal boilerplate for future use). → A: Minimal Docusaurus config
- Q: What should be the initial content of `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`? Should it be a basic Docusaurus deploy workflow for GitHub Pages, or should it include placeholders for advanced features (e.g., custom domain, environment variables, multi-stage deployment) that will be configured later? → A: Basic Docusaurus deploy workflow for GitHub Pages

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: The system MUST create a root directory named `physical-ai-humanoid-robotics-textbook`.
- **FR-002**: The system MUST establish the standard Docusaurus v3 folder structure within the root directory.
- **FR-003**: The system MUST include a minimal, standard Docusaurus v3 configuration in `docusaurus.config.js` and `package.json` for immediate GitHub Pages deployment.
- **FR-004**: The system MUST create dedicated top-level folders for `specs/`, `docs/chapters/`, `docs/assets/images/`, `docs/assets/files/`, and `RAG-backend/`.
- **FR-005**: The system MUST create placeholder files for bonus features: `src/pages/_bonus_auth.js`, `src/pages/_bonus_personalization.js`, `src/pages/_bonus_urdu.js`.
- **FR-006**: The system MUST include a `.gitignore` file and a `README.md` file at the root level.
- **FR-007**: The system MUST include a basic Docusaurus deploy workflow for GitHub Pages in `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`.
- **FR-008**: The system MUST NOT include any actual chapter content in the `.md` files at this stage.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

- **Project Structure**: The hierarchical arrangement of files and directories.
- **Docusaurus Configuration**: Files (`docusaurus.config.js`, `package.json`, etc.) that define the behavior and appearance of the Docusaurus site.
- **Content Folders**: Directories (`docs/chapters/`, `docs/assets/`) designated for textbook content and associated media.
- **Bonus Feature Placeholders**: Empty files representing future functionality.
- **Deployment Workflow**: Configuration (`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`) for automating the deployment process to GitHub Pages.

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: All specified directories and files are present in the `physical-ai-humanoid-robotics-textbook` root directory, verifiable by `ls -R` output matching the expected structure.
- **SC-002**: The generated file structure is immediately compatible with Docusaurus v3, as confirmed by successful initialization commands (e.g., `npm install` and `npm start` should execute without structure-related errors, though content will be empty).
- **SC-003**: The deployment workflow file (`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`) is correctly placed and named, ready for configuration.
